# About the project
https://online-tictactoe.netlify.app/

A system that allows you to play tic-tac-toe in different ways.
It uses some artificial intelligence algorithms, which allows you to play alone against the computer in 3 different difficulties: easy | random | ultra hard.
In addition, Socket.IO is used to implement a multiplayer mode, which allows you to play against another person while chatting with them, be it a random opponent or a specific friend.

This is the Front End repo of the project, the Back End repo is here: https://github.com/LUC4T0N1/AI-Tic-Tac-Toe-Back-End

## Modes
There are two main modes -> Singleplayer and Multiplayer

### Singleplayer
In singleplayer mode, the system gives you 3 different difficulties top choose:
- Easy -> it uses the minmax algorithm to calculate the worst play as possible making the player always win
- Random -> it makes random plays
- Ultra Hard -> it uses the minmax algorithm to calculate the best play as possible making the player never win

### Multiplayer
In Multiplayer mode, the system uses websockets to create a connection between the players, who have 2 options:
- Random opponent -> It puts you in a queue and matches you with another player in that queue.
